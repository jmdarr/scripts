### copy_wp_site.sh

This script is intended to copy one WP site from a local location, sed the database around so that it changes the domain and then shove it into a new location. It's not yet finished.

### freenas/check_openvpn.sh

This script will use geoip to ensure that your location gotten matches a string. I use to to make sure openvpn has me pegged to a safe place for torrenting.
